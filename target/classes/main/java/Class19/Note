MethodOverriding:
    When we have exact same methods in parent and child class. we call it MethodOverriding.

Why should we learn about Overriding?
    Method Overriding give us a lot flexibility for Example: if we don't like a method from
    the parent class we can override it/change.

    Note: if we have some value in the Parent class then in Child class we want to make changes in the
    value in the same method we should use the Method Overriding.

Syntax:
   Class Parent{
     void eat(){
     sout "Fish"
     }
     }

     Class Child extend Parent{

     void eat(){
     sout "Chicken"
     }
     }
