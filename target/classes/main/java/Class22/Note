Collection Framework:
   Its collection of class and interface which help us build dynamic program which are capable of
   handling large amount of data.
   Note: Collection Framework can't work with primitive type.
   Note: if we want too store the number in our code then we should use the Integer like:
   ArrayList<Integer> number=new ArrayList<Integer>();
           Integer num1= new Integer(10);
           Integer num2=new Integer(20);
           System.out.println(num1+num2);

Why we should learn about Collection framework?
  Array is not good and we need something that is dynamic and more flexible for Example:
   1) they are fix size.
   2) no ready made methods we have to create our own.

ArrayList:
   Arraylist is better version than array, It is also index based. Its dynamic we don't need to provide
   the size before hand and it contain a lot of method to manipulate the data inside it.

Syntax:
   for Array we used this syntax   DataType [] nameForArray= new DataType [size]
   String [] arr=new String[5];
   ArrayList<DataType> nameForArrayList=new ArrayList<>();
   ArrayList<String> arr=new ArrayList<>();

Methods From ArrayList:
    Size()=> No of elements.
    add(element)=> adds new element to the arrayList
    get(Index)=> Returns the element on specified index.
    remove(index)=> remove the element from the arrayList
    indexOf(element) => Returns the index of the element.
    Contains(element) => returns true if element is present otherwise false
