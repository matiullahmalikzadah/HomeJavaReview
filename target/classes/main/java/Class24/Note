Maps:
    Maps are dataStructures which stores key value pairs.
    There are many different types of maps in java but we will be discussing 1) HashMp 2)LinkedHashMap
    3)TreeMap 4)HashTable. Maps are not part of collection framework. Maps is the name of interface and
    HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap and HashTable are the classes that implement this interface
Why we should learn about Maps?
    All the other dataStructures that we have learnt can only store one value at a time and they are
    indexed based.
    Maps allow us to store key value pairs(Joft or Jora)  which makes the a better choice because we know that we are
    storing.
Syntax of Maps:
   NameOfTheClass<DataType,DataTypeOfValue> variableName=new NameOfTheClass<>();
   HahMap<String,Double> names=new HashMap<>();



Note: Map is collection of entries.
      Entries are collection key value pairs.
