Method Overloading:
    Methods overloading happen when multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters.
    it can be on three difference
    1) Different number of parameters for Example main(2,3) main(4,5,6)
    2) Different datatype of method print(:java"), print(12);
    3) Different sequence/ order of parameters print("java" ,12) print(12,"java")

Why should we learn about method overloading?
    1) clear code
    2) We don't need come up with different method names


Syntax:
   class Calculator{

     int add(int a, int b)
     return a+b;
   }

   int add(int a, int b, int c)
        return a+b+c;
      }

      double add(double a, double b)
           return a+b;
         }

MethodOverriding:
    MethodOverriding happen when same name method is present in parent as well as in child class.
    note: methodOverriding means (rewrite) a method the same name we have in parent class also we have in child class
    like: in AnimalConstructor class in this package. and when we want to print on the Tester class then we
    will get the child result from print.
    note: without inheritance method overriding is not possible.

Rules:
   1) must be IS-A relationship (inheritance).
   2) method must have same name as in the parent class and child class.
   3) method must have same parameter as in the parent class.
   4) method must have the same return type as in parent class.

Note:
   Signature of a method:
      method name plus its parameters are called signature of a method.
   Header of a method:
      Header of a method includes signature plus return type plus access modifier.

Topics to revise for Selenium.
   1) Classes and Objects
   2) Methods
   3) String methods
   4) loops
   5) if-else
Approach:
   1) Read slides if something is not clear watch short videos for youtube for that
   specific topic
   2) Solve your HW/Repls again.
