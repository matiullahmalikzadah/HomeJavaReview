File?
   File is something that we use to store information.
   For Example:
   1) txt files are used to store raw text.
   2) odf files are usually to store books and articles.
   3) xlsx files are usually to store information in the form of a table.
   4) .jpg .jpeg .png files are used to store images.
   5) .mp4 .mkv .mov are used to store video
Why we should use Files?
    Its easier to move information around because it just one single flie.
Folder/Directories:
   Its like a container for files. it can contain many different files.
   we use it to organize information's.
File Handling:
   File is process of creating/Editing/accessing/deleting the file on a computer with the help of a
   programming language
Steps work with files:
   1) to the locate file usually we use the absolute path for the
   foe Example: "C:\Users\malik\OneDrive\Desktop\ReviewPracticeJava\Salaries.xlsx"
   2) We need to have access and a piece of software that can edit/open that file.
   3) To bring files from permanent storage into the RAM.

What is Ram:
   Temporary storage its very fast but very expensive and does not store data permanently
   once we turn off the computer everything that we put in the RAM is gone.

What is HDD/SDD/NVME/Storage?
   it is permanent storage that we use to store things cheap but slow .
Why we should lear about the File Handling?
   1) So that we can store data permanent.
   2) we can store the sensitive data like UserName password etc.. inside the file and keep
   them secure on our computer and don't push it with code on github.
   3) All the configuration related information like URLS and types of testing will
   also be stored in the files


Note:
   firt we should create the file how to we create the file:
   1- when we right click on the our project then we create the Directory the rename the directory
   then we should right click on the Directory and make a file then we should store the data
   inside of the file then we should right click on the
   file and cope path then we create class in java and past on the String of the class. then
   we should move the Ram how we should mover to the RAM? we should create this code:
   String path="C:\\Users\\malik\\IdeaProjects\\JavaReview\\files\\Cinfig.properties";
           System.out.println(path);
           // moves the file from permanent storage into the RAM.
           FileInputStream file=new FileInputStream(path);
           //That one class/Software that will assist us to read Write the data from the file.
           Properties properties=new Properties();
           properties.load(file);
                   System.out.println(properties.get("userName"));
                   System.out.println(properties.get("Password"));
                   System.out.println(properties.get("URL"));
