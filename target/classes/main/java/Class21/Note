Encapsulation:
It is one of the four fundamental OOp concepts.
    Create classes to write code and store data. use private access modifier to secure the data by
    limiting the access. Create getter (is for Read the code) Setter(is for update the code) methods for
    every field if you want others to change or see those fields.

Why should we learn about Encapsulation?
    1) it improves the control over the data that we store in the fields of a class which lead us to
    more secure code.
