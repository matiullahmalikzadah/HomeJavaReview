Object oriented programming (OOP):
      Its just a way(Set of rules) of writing code
      Its basically helps us write large amounts of code. That is easies to change and manage. There are other ways
      like functional programming and procedural programming.
Why we should use OOP?
      1)It help us write large amounts of codes easily.
      2) It also helps us represent the world around us inside computer easily.
      3) changing code become easier.
      4) Sharing code ans collaboration becomes easier.
Main Concepts/Main Pillars of OOP:
      1) Classes and Objects. (Base not considered main pillar)
      2) Inheritance .
      3) Polymorphism
      4) Abstraction
      5) Encapsulation
Classes and Objects:
      A Class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we
      start building the actual object. Classes have properties/attributes which
      helps us figure out how something looks like and they have behaviors/function
      which help us understand how something works.
