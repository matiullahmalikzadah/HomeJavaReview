Constructors:
     Constructors help us create the objects from the classes in a             and neat way. we can
     also put piece of code that we want to execute.
Why we should use Constructors?
     1) They help use write more secure classes.
     2) Cleaner code.
     3) More control over the value that we can assign to the instance fields.

Syntax:
     1) Usually public access modifier.
     2) Same name as class name.
     3) No return type not even void.
     4) Parameters
     5) Body of the constructor.

Rules:











Note/: if instance variable and value will be the same name on that time we have to use this.  .
        // like: this.name=name;
