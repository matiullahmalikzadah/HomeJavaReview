accesses modifiers:
    accesses modifiers are keywords in java that help us control the access of instance and static
    variables they can also be used to control the access of the methode and classes.
    Note: this will help us to control who can access in our code who can not control or access in our code.
    Like: if we create a bank account for the customer doesn't need to be share with other classes or
    other person in this time we should use access modifiers.

    There are four access levels and there are three keywords in java to apply these access levels.
     Private protected default public

Best Practices:
   Instance variables/fields/properties/attributes are private 99% the time.
   99% of the times constructors are public.
   90 of the times methods are public 8% private and rest of the
   time they are default or protected.
   note: we can you behavior and if condition insode of the costructors.
