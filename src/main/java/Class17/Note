Inheritance:
    Inheritance allows one class to have all the properties and methods from another class except
    private members and constructions.
    We use extends keyword.
Why should we learn about Inheritance?
    1) faster development
    2) Save memory

Syntax:
    class Parent{


    }

    class Child extend parent{


    }


Rules:
   1) Private members are not accessible in child classes.
   2) Constructors are also no available for child classes directly.

Types of Inheritance:
    1) Single Inheritance.
    2) Hierarchical Inheritance.
    3) MultiLevel Inheritance.
    4) Hybrid Inheritance
    5) Multiple Inheritance (It is not supported by java).

1) Single Inheritance:
    only one parent and only child (Not very common).

2) Hierarchical Inheritance.
    One parent multiple child.

3) MultiLevel Inheritance:
    MultiLevel Inheritance happens when a class C inherits from B and B inherits from A like: C<-B<-A
    Note:in this type we inherits from grandFader to Father and from Father to child

4) Hybrid Inheritance:
   4) Hybrid Inheritance is a mixture of Hierarchical nad MultiLevel Inheritance.

5) Multiple Inheritance:
   Multiple parent classes and one child class. It is not supported by java.
   note: multiple inheritance not allowed in java meaning a class can't inheritance from
   multiple classes at the same time.

What is Diamond problem in OOP?
   The abigmuity that arises when two classes A and C inherit fromA, and a further class D inherits
   from both B and C, so that if there is a method in A that B and/or C has overridden,
   and D does not override it, it is unclear which version of the method D should inherit.




Not: it is like methode class to share the original code with other classes and we use extend
on the class then if we want to make change in the single class we can do it. also in inheritance
woke from parents to child class no from child to parents class
