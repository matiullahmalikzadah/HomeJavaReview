Constructors:
     Constructors help us build objects from classes easily.they help us give initialize the
     instance fields. the name of the constructor must be same as the class name.
     Constructors don't have any return types. most of the time constructors are public.
     other than initializing the values we can have whatever type of code inside the constructor that
     we like for example calling methods writing if-else ets..
     Note: Constructors just we can use in Private.
     not: also we can have more than one constructor as well.

Class  ClassName{
// this is parameter
String name;

public ClassName(){

}
public ClassName(String myName){
name=myName;
}
