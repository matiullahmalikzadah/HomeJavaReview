Arithmetic Operations:
      These operations help us perform simple mathematical operations like
      Addition             => +
      Subtraction           => -
      Multiplication        => *
      Division              => %
      Modulus               => %

Shorthand Operators:
     They help us perform mathematical operations but using a little shorter syntax.
     like:
     add and update the variable Example: int a=10   a+=20   =>30

 Relational Operation:
 These operators help us compare things.
 	== check if two objects are equal
 	!= checks if two objects are not equals
 	>Great than
 	>Less than
 	>=greater than equal
 	>=less than equal
 Logical Operators:
 They help us combine multiple Boolean conditions
    ! Not
    || Or
    && And
 Increment/ Decrement Operators:
 ++
 --
