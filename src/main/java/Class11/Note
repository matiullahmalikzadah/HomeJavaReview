String Class:
    String class is designed to store symbols (letters(A,B,C..), numbers(1,34,445,66,666..),
    special characters(#,$,%,*...)) IN THE FORM OF A GROUP. there are money methods already written by java developers
    that we can just use. this is the most widely used class in java.
    fro example:
    length()
    startWith()
    endsWith()
    contains()
Why we should learn about this class?
    1) very important for coding questions.
    2) Most widely used class in all java.
    3)Most of the information in real life is present in the form of String.
Method Chaining;
    when multiple methods are being called on the same line its called method chaining.
    String class support method chaining. for nethod chaining to work pervios method must
    return the expected datatype for the next method.
    Example:

    String str"Batch 17 IS GREAT.     ";
       System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().trim().replace("great","good"));










    Note:
    very important for coding question in interview
    1)If else
    2) Loops
    3)Arrays
    4)Strings
