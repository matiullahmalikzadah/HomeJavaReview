Encapsulation:
It is one of the four fundamental OOp concepts.
    Create classes to write code and store data. use private access modifier to secure the data by
    limiting the access. Create getter (is for Read the code) Setter(is for update the code) methods for
    every field if you want others to change or see those fields.

Why should we learn about Encapsulation?
    1) it improves the control over the data that we store in the fields of a class which lead us to
    more secure code.

Collections framework:
    Collections framework in java contains a lot of classes and interfaces. Which help us store and
    manipulate large amounts of data easily and efficiently.
Why Collections framework:
    Array have limitation
    1) They are fixed in size meaning once we provide the size we can't change it afterwards.
    2) They don't have any built-in methods to help us process the data.
Note: with ArrayList we don't need for siz it is very easily to store the value with out the size also
    every method is here  .
