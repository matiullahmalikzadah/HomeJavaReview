Object:
    An object is something that we can physically touch it. Everything around us like
    chairs, table, mouse, etc.. They are all object. we can easily represent these object inside our computer by
    telling a computer how an object look like and how it behaves.

Class:
    A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.

String class:
    A String class is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the information inside computers is
    this form. String is most widely used class in all java.

Creating objects from String class:
