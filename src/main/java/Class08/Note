Enhanced for Loop:
      enhanced for loop is used to iterate through data
      structure which have multiples items stored inside them.

Why should we use enhanced for loop?
      it simple and easy to understand.
Syntax:
      for(DataTypeOfElement anyVariableName : NameOfTheDataType){

      }

Limitations of enhanced for loop:
      1) Enhanced for loop can not be used for updating the element.
      2) Access the element in the reverse order etc.

break:
      break keyword is used in switch cases statement and with the loop
      to terminate the loops prematurely.
why we should use break keyword?
      using break keyword can help save a lot of processing time and our code can
      execute faster.
continue:
       continue keyword is used to kip the code from a loop once we hit the skip keyword
       java ignores the rest of the code in the loop and jumps to next iteration
