Type of variables:
      there are three types of variables. local instance and static.
Local Variables:
      local variables are the variables which are created. declared inside a block of code. like
      if else conditions, loop, switch statement, methods are block of code.
Upside:
    they occupy the memory for shortest period of time. as soon java is done executing that block
    of code they are removed from the memory.
    the code that we write using local variable is very easy to debug.

Downside:
    they can only be accessed within the block of code they are created.

Instance variables:
     Instance variables are the variables which are created outside of the block(if else,
      switch, loops or methods etc.) of code bu inside a class.

upside:
      they can be accessed any where within the that class.
downside:
     they are created when an object of the class is created and they will stay in the memory
     as long as that object is in the memory weather you use the or not.

Local vs Instance variables:
     whenever it is possible go and create locale variable. only go with instance variables
     when you can't solve a problem with local variables.

Static Variables:
     static variables are create inside a class but outside of block of code with a static keyword.
     Note: before the Instance variable we will use (static) word that will be static variable.
     and local variable can not be static variable.

Upside:
     They are universal when it comes to scope and accessibility. we don't even need to create the object
     of that class in which they are created we can simply write the name of the class and we
     can access it.
Downside:
     Static variables occupy the memory for longer off all.
     they are create even though you don't create any object of that class.

Uses type of local variables:
  Local:
    when ever we are solving my problem many times we need locale variables to temporally store
    data. in all these cases you should be going with local variables.
