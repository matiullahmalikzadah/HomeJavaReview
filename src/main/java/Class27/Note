Types of Errors in Java:
    there are three main types of errors in java.
    2) Syntax errors/Compile Time errors
    2) Logical errors/Bugs
    3) Runtime Errors/Exceptions


Syntax errors/Compile Time errors
Note: if we don't follow the java rules and we get the error this is Syntax errors/Compile Time errors
or when we print the not follow java rules and the result also is Syntax errors/Compile Time errors.
like: if we want to write age int=10 or we want to write name String="jan"; this code ir wrong this is
Syntax errors/Compile Time errors if we want to print this code also the result of these codes are
Syntax errors/Compile Time errors. this type of error will use by developer
Example:
     int age=10;
     age int=10;
How to solve Syntax errors/Compile Time errors?
   1) Most of the time your IDE (Integrated development environment)  is going to help you.
   2) Compiler will also generate an error with line numbers and explanations.
   3) you can look for the rules of that language.

Logical errors/Bugs:
      Logical occur when programs do not generate the expected outputs.
      Note: if we write the right code and then we want to print or run the code hen the result will
      print the wrong this time of error called Logical errors/Bugs.
How to fix the Logical errors/Bugs?
   we can use debugger to fix Logical errors/Bugs. these type of error will use by tester

Runtime Errors/Exceptions:
     Runtime error or exceptions are unwanted events that disrupts the normal flow of a program.
     Note: if we write a code to test a application or other then our code will be error but
     don't giver error show in the code and will run it then the print
     side give us error massage this error called Runtime Errors/Exceptions. like:
     System.out.println(10/10); but this code will give us error.
